I recommend trying, especially if you're frustrated by the amount of terminals you have to open every time. Thank you Nguyen."

I can easily log-in to my remote server session with VSCode, run Terminal activate, and there are all my terminals."

Kind of annoying you have to customize your shell from the config(session.json), wish you could auto-save currently opened sessions from the ctrl+shift+p vs code menu. Besides that it's great!!! Thanks to the creator of this app!!!"
